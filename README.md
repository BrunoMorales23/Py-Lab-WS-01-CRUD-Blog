# ⚙️ Py-Lab-WS-01-CRUD-Blog ⚙️

This project, is the first one of a series of repositories that consists on different kind of exercises to practice certain points of web development with Python.
The idea of this particular repository, is to build a (actually) usable and working blog, where i will post my thoughts and personal logs as a record of my progress.
This exercise consist on working on my first 'CRUD' application, on which i will be able to create, read, update and delete my logs.

---

As a personal note, this exercise gave me the skill of creating static and freely accessible 'url' for specific logs, which i couldn't make on my project, 'Chess-Coach'.
